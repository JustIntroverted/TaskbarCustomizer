## What is this?
This is an application that allows you to manipulate certain aspects of the Taskbar on Windows 10.  You can change if the Start button is visible, and you can change whether the Show Desktop button is visible.  Along with those nifty features, you can also change the positioning of all pinned Taskbar items, and the position of the IconTray and Clock.
